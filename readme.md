# Tip Calculator

This is a **Tip Calculator** application that helps users calculate tips and split the total meal cost among a specified number of people. It allows users to input the total bill amount, select a service rating, and view the tip percentage applied. The calculator then calculates the tip, total amount, and amount per person in an elegant and user-friendly interface.

4. The app will **automatically calculate**:
   - The **tip amount** based on the service rating.
   - The **total amount** including the tip.
   - The **amount per person** based on the total amount and number of people.
